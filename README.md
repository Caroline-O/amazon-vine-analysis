# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyze data based on reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.  The analysis also incorporated a review of data on non vine members in order to draw a comparison with the goal being to determine if vine members are biased to leave a positive review. 

## Results
1. In total there were 334 vine reviews and 61,614 non vine reviews.

2. Of these reviews, 139 vine reviews and 32,665 non vine reviews were 5-star reviews.

3. 41.6% of the vine reviews were a 5-star while 53.0% of the non vine reviews were a 5-star.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, it does not appear that vine member reviews are biased in a positive way.  The data supports that non vine members tend to be more positive in their reviews, but overall, it is relatively balanced between the two. That being said, a review calculating the percentage of negative (1-star) reviews could be done to see if the evidence for no bias holds or an analysis that includes the percentage of 4 and 5-star reviews to see if vine members actually do have a positive bias.  In addition, further analysis using reviews on different products/in different categories should be conducted to see if this pattern and result are consistent.
